# Blue-Cogs
Python Modules for Discord bot
# Installation
First make sure you have [Red Bot V3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/V3/develop) installed.

Next add my repo using the following command:  

`[p]repo add blue-cogs https://github.com/BlueSoD/Blue-Cogs`    

> [p] will be your prefix.

Then, you will have to download each cog individually. For example, if you want to download Casino, you would enter the following command:

`>cog install blue-cogs wp-rolesync`

Make sure that you use the `[p]cog update` command to periodically update my plugins. This will ensure that you are getting the latest bug fixes and features. You may also update a specific cog by typing `[p]cog update wp-rolesync`.
